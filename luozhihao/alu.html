      The Arithmetic and Logical Unit is responsible for arithmetical and
      logical calculations as well as taking decisions in the system. It is also
      known as the mathematical brain of the computer. The ALU makes use of
      registers for the calculations. It takes input from input registers,
      performs operations on the data, and stores the output in an output
      register.

    <h3>Functions of ALU:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is mainly used to make decisions like performing arithmetic and
        logical operations.
      </li>
      <li>
        It acts as a bridge between the computerâ€™s primary memory and the
        secondary memory. All information that is exchanged between the primary
        and secondary memory passes through the ALU.
