        The Decoding process allows the cpu to sort out different instructions to be accessed by the corresponding correct execution units.<br> A <span>decoder</span> is responsible for this process. Decoders are combinational circuits that convert binary into 2N-bit outputs.

         In this process, cpu determines its following behavior based on the form of the instruction. Instructions are divided into meaningful parts to be executed.
        <br>
        Decode often involves these following steps:
        <ol>
            <li><span>Parse opcode</span> : CPU parses the opcodes which are in the instruction into different corresponding operation categories. For example, arithmetic operation and logical operation.</li>
            <li><span>Resolute register operand</span> : CPU needs to resolve the register number of the operand if it is involved in the instruction.</li>
            <li><span>Resolute memory operand </span>: CPU needs to parse the memory address and read the corresponding data from the memory if the instruction contains memory operand.</li>
            <li><span>Parse control flow </span>: CPU needs to parse the destination address of the flow instructions if the instruction contains control flow instructions, such as jump or branch.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
