      A bus is a link between the different components of the computer system
      and the processor. They are used to send signals and data from the
      processor to different devices and vice versa. There are three types of
      buses â€“ Address bus which is used to send memory address from process to
      other components. The data bus, which is used to send actual data from the
      processor to the components, and the Control bus, used to send control
      signals from the processor to other devices.
