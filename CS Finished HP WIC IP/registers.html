      Registers are part of a computer's memory that is used to store the
      instructions temporarily to provide the processor with the instructions at
      times of need. These registers are also known as Processor registers as
      they play an important role in the processing of data. These registers
      store data in the form of memory address and after the processing of the
      instruction present at that memory address is completed, it stores the
      memory address of the next instruction. There are various kinds of
      registers that perform different functions.

    <h3>Functions of Registers:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Input registers are used to carry the input.</li>
      <li>Output registers are used to carry the output.</li>
      <li>Temporary registers store data temporarily.</li>
      <li>Address registers store the address of the memory.</li>
      <li>The program counter stores the address of the instructions.</li>
      <li>Data registers hold the memory operand.</li>
      <li>Instruction registers hold the instruction codes.</li>
    </ul>
