		<h1>What is CPU?</h1>
	</header>
	<main>
		<p1>Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the brain of a computer that processes all functions related to the input, output and storage of data, designed to control the functions of all the significant components in the computer. It contains three main parts which are the control unit, arithmetic logic unit and storage unit. It processes work following the fetch-decode-execute-store cycle and is designed in different architectural styles.

		<h1>The history of CPU</h1>
	</header>
	<main class="main2">
		<p2>The history started in 1823 when Baron Jons Jakob Berzelius discovered silicon which was a crucial element in manufacturing CPUs. From the 1900s to the 1960s it was the development of electric circuits and transistors. However, it was a significant revolution in CPU development in the 1970s, with several commercial CPUs being introduced to the market, such as the first single integrated circuit chip, Intel 4004, and the first x86 instruction set processor, Intel 8008. Progress continued through the 1980s and 1990s, and in the 1990s, engineers in Japan's Hitachi discovered a new way to reduce the compression of instruction sets which contributed to the development of the first ARM architecture set. In 2005, AMD published the first dual-core processor, and the development of CPUs continues to advance today.

		<h1>Different types of CPU</h1>
	</header>
	<header>
		<h3>Single-Core CPU</h>
	</header>
	<main class="main3">
        <p1>This is the oldest design of CPU which adopt in 1970s. It can only process one single task at one time by its single core since it only carries one set of operation units.
		</p1>
	</main>
	<header>
		<h3>Dual-Core CPU</h>
	</header>
	<main class="main4">
        <p1>This is a CPU contains two integrated circuit in a single chip. It is able to process multitasking work at one time. The operation sets inside is highly linked with each core which allow high efficiency performance.
		</p1>
	</main>
	<header>
		<h3>Quad-Core CPU</h>
	</header>
	<main class="main4">
        <p1>This CPU contains two dual core in single chip. It has the highest efficiency which processes functions with four independent unit. It can run multiple task at the same time parallelly.

	</main>
	<header>
		<h1>Inside the CPU</h1>
	</header>
	
	<main class="main5">
        <p1>Inside the CPU, there are billions of tiny electrical parts forming an integrated cricuit and fitting into the compact box. It also contains two types of layers which is the physical layer and the abstraction layer. Combining it, this make a powerful CPU.
