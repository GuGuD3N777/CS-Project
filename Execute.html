        The task in this process is to complete the various commands that instructions need, finally to utilize the function of instructions. During this process, different parts and units of cpu are linked together to execute to meet the demands. For example, if there is an instruction which calls for mathematics calculation, the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) would be then linked between an input and an output, where the input requires the values to be calculated, and the output would give the final calculated result.

        <span>It is worthy noting that there are a series of instructions being executed simultaneously inside the cpu, to ensure the efficiency of instruction processing. Modern cpus utilize a technique called pipelining, in which multiple instructions are divided into several stages, then to be executed at the same time.</span>
